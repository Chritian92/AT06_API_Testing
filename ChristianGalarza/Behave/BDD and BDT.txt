When and why BDD was defined
A BDD is defined when the whole team (PO, QA, Dev) work together
and with fewer barriers in the development of a software or a function,
avoiding misunderstandings.

The most important aspects of BDD

The most important aspects is that it is a kind of similar software development
to TDD but combined with accepting testing.


Why is it useful and could it be applied?
To ensure that it meets all the requirements of the end user.


Which type of teams could implement BDD
The teams that have the time to gather the team members
to be able to coordinate, you can not use this software development system
for teams that team members can not coordinate.

Differences between BDD and BDT
Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile testing methodology. 
BDT - Behavior driven testing, usually come after / during BDD 
(Behavior Driven development) but it is not necessary, it can be organized 
with traditional testing as well.

BDD is a process of development based on test-driven development (TDD). 
BDD blends main standards of test-driven development and ideas from 
domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis to provide software 
developers and business analysts with shared tools and a shared process
to collaborate on software development.

The goal of BDT is a business readable and domain specific language
that allows you to describe a behavior of a system without putting 
details on how that behavior is developed.

In BDT, Tests in the form of simple text features/descriptions 
with scenarios are typically written before anything else and 
checked by the non-technical shareholders.
